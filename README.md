# ML-for-Bioinformarics-HWs(Practical)

This repository contains my codes and solutions for homework of Machine Learning for Bioinformatics course held at Sharif University of Technology (SUT) by Prof. Ali Sharifi Zarchi in Spring 2023.

# HW1:

Linear Regression and Regularization: We want to train a model which estimates obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions of an individual. For our purpose, we will use a dataset of individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Columbia.  

Spectral Clustering: Clustering on Cancer Gene Expression RNA-seq dataset

# HW2:

Random Forest and XGBoost model on Breast_Cancer dataset.

Support Vector Machines: In this assignment, we are going to implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm that determines which patient is in danger and which is not.

# HW3:

MLP: In this assignment we'll be working with Dorothea Dataset.(DOROTHEA is a drug discovery dataset. Chemical compounds represented by structural molecular features must be classified as active (binding to thrombin) or inactive.)

VAE on MNIST dataset.

# HW4:

CNN: In this exercise we are going to train a CNN-based model for a multi-class classification task, brain abnormality classification. The dataset we are going to use is a small imbalanced one that contains MRIs of both normal and abnormal brains.

Image Captioning: In this assignment, we will be creating and training a neural network to generate captions for images using the MS-COCO dataset.
